            Michael might be pursuing front-end web development as a long-term career. However, in his free time, he mostly spends his time participating in the hobbies he enjoys. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!
            Michael is interested in being a part-time film reviewer since he is passionate about watching and discussing movies and television. Some of his favorite films include It's a Wonderful Life, 
            The Godfather 1 and 2, Goodfellas, 12 Angry Men, Parasite, Chinatown, LOTR trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back, Toy Story 1-3, Whiplash, Pulp Fiction, and The Incredibles. His favorite television shows include
            Breaking Bad, The Andy Griffith Show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, SpongeBob SquarePants (pre-movie era), Courage the Cowardly Dog, Justice League, Samurai Jack, Ozark, and The Kominsky Method. Additionally, 
            Michael is an avid gamer. His favorite video games include New Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Overwatch 2, Super Mario Maker, and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. 
            Furthermore, he plans to create his own video games once he hones his skills in game development. Recently, Michael has found the time to read a few full-length novels and draw sketches of fictional characters. 
            He also loves to spend time with his family and close friends, sometimes going on vacations with them. Web development is the job Michael chose to pursue,
           who said it also couldn't be a hobby? He creates professional websites not just for clients and businesses, but personal websites for himself as well.<br>
